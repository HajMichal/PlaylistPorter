## Good to know
This service is a Single Page Application with a minimalist design, and all logic is handled server-side. I created this project for a friend who needed an efficient way to transfer songs from YouTube playlists to Spotify. The programme handles maximum 100 songs simultaneously. 

<br/>

## Workflow
The first thing the user needs to do is authorize through their Google and Spotify accounts. After this step, all they need to do is paste the links to the YouTube and Spotify playlists and click the 'Transform' button. After a second or two, the songs will be transferred.

## Why I choose NestJs ?

<br/>

I took some time to decide which technology to use for writing this API. I considered NestJs, FastApi, or Flask. NestJs has modular structure allows me to easily and clearly expand the application. NestJs also has the best documentation, although Python's FastApi is also very well done. There are many resources and solved problems available for the entire NodeJs ecosystem, which also makes work easier and faster. Another advantage of Node is the ability to use TypeScript, which also facilitates development. Considering all these arguments and the fact that I have the most experience with Node, I decided to choose `NestJs`.

## Main Stack:
 - React,
 - Typescirpt,
 - NestJs
